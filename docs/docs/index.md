# Introduction

GymOS is an open source, gym managment solution aimed at helping individual trainers and small studios build their brand and connect with clients. 

It's designed to be a PWA (Progressive Web App), meaning that users have the option to "install" it on their devices and interact with it similar to how they interact with native applications.

It's also designed to work with various outside systems to offload tasks such as email marketing, text and email reminders, payment processing and more.

GymOS is free and open source, so you can [download](https://github.com/KMWilliams-Dev/GymOS/releases), build, and deploy the application yourself folowing the documentation, or you can contact me via [mail](mailto:kevin.williams@kevinwilliams.dev) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/22ZaTAZP45) and I can deploy it on your behalf for a small fee.
