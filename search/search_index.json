It's designed to be a PWA (Progressive Web App), meaning that users have the option to \"install\" it on their devices and interact with it similar to how they interact with native applications. It's also designed to work with various outside systems to offload tasks such as email marketing, text and email reminders, payment processing and more. GymOS is free and open source, so you can download , build, and deploy the application yourself folowing the documentation, or you can contact me via mail or Discord and I can deploy it on your behalf for a small fee.

The two needed components are a host machine to serve the app from, and a database to store the information. From within the host machine you have a number of different components: Client App : The client app is the actual interface / website that a user sees and interacts with. When someone talks about GymOS, this is likely what they're referring to. Server App : The server app is the server-side component of GymOS. It contains all of the business logic, endpoints, task scheduling, services etc. Controllers : The Controllers are the API endpoints that are called from the client. These endpoints can also be called from external applications as long as the requests are authenticated Task Scheduler : The task scheduler is a set of recurring events that are executed, such as automatic emails, data cleanup, class scheduling, etc. Business Logic : The business logic contains all of the actual logic that happens when someone registers, signs into a class, makes a purchase, and more. It is separated from the actual controllers and server logic in order to keep separation of concerns and make the system more flexible Services : Services are the pieces of the system that interact with the outside world. Rather than managing our own emails, payments, etc, we will just interface with a provider that specializes in those areas.","title":"Developer Reference"},{"location":"devreference/#developer-reference","text":"","title":"Developer Reference"},{"location":"devreference/#system-architecture","text":"GymOS is setup to be modular so it works with a variety of providers and services.
